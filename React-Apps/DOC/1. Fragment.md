    Fragments are syntax that allow us to add multiple elements to a React component without wrapping them in an extra DOM node.

## Problem:

If we want to render something like this,

    const App = () => {
        return (
            <p>I would</p>
            <p>really like</p>
            <p>to render</p>
            <p>an array</p>
        );
    }

we will get an error, saying

    > **_JSX expressions must have one parent element._**

>Whatâ€™s happening behind the curtain here? JSX is turning all of our <div>s and <MyComponent>s into 
React.createElement() calls â€” when the JSX transpiler sees multiple elements instead of a single element, it doesnâ€™t know what tag name to render with. See React.createElement in the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#createelement).

We can solve this problem by wrapping a **div** around it, but most cases **div** results in useless markup and sometimes even invalid HTML to be rendered. To solve this problem Fragment came into play.

## Solution

Fragment groups a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
